# DGCDR

Pytorch implementation for paper _Enhancing Transferability and Consistency in Cross-Domain Recommendations via Supervised Disentanglement_.

## Datasets
The dataset is processed based on [Amazon](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/index.html)[[1]](#1), Douban[[2]](#2). 

Each domain contains a interaction file in the following format:

| Suffix | Content | Format |
|---|---|---|
| *.inter* | User-item interaction | user_id, item_id, rating |

## Training
You can use this command to train the model:

`python run_recbole_cdr.py`

The configuration settings are in a YAML file in  DGCDR/recbole_cdr/properties/.

## Acknowledgement
The implementation is based on the open-source recommendation library [RecBole-CDR](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole-CDR).
